            <h1>Come visit Columbia, Maryland!</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Columbia is a planned community unveiled by James Rouse on June 21st, 1967. One of the defining characteristics of Columbia is its composition of 10 small villages. Each village was designed to be fully self-sufficient, each featuring schools, shopping centers, recreational facilities, and a community center. These villages are frequently interlaced with extensive foot and bike paths that serve to further connect the villages to themselves and others. And if you can't find what you're looking for here, Baltimore, Annapolis, and Washington D.C. are all about a half an hour away!</p>

            <p>I've lived in Columbia for over 30 years, and, despite being a shut-in, I've still gotten to know it well. The integrated design of the town fosters a diverse and active community, with plenty of venues and activites besides those mentioned. Look me up if you're ever in the area, I'll happily explore with you!</p>
